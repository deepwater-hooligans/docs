# Welcome to Deepwater Hooligans!

Welcome to the most crunchwrap supreme mid-scale pvp group.

**Please read this entire document.**  We have done our best to keep it short.

## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay on BIGAB comms:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

## Comms Etiquette:

* During fleet operations, our comms channels can quickly become congested due to the size of our fleets.
* Unless explicitly permitted by the fleet organizer, please be considerate of your fellow alliance members and the fleet's command team.
* Ensure that comms remain clear to facilitate the effective relay and discussion of vital information.
* Even during moments that seem quiet, keep in mind that important discussions may be ongoing in the command whisper channel.
* Please note that not adhering to these rules may lead to global muting measures.

Lastly, don't be a dick. There should not need to be any examples cited for this. If you have to question whether your actions are unbecoming, they probably are. Be nice to your corp mates and alliance members, don't spam egregiously in local, don't leak anything said in any channel in BIGAB discord for any reason. This rule is interpreted by real people, not a machine, so toeing of the line will not be allowed and if you are found to violate this rule excessively, you will be removed.

## Current staging

`Turnur - Fronk's Castle` - All subcaps and capitals **Deathclones Here**

`Amamake - Hydra Provail` - Supercaps

### Turnur

The EVE system "Turnur" recently experienced an event where the star in the system exploded. This event has caused the appearance of 6 static wormholes in the system. These wormholes consist of 3 nullsec wormholes, 2 lowsec wormholes, and 1 highsec. These provide access to different areas of space for roaming, whaling, or other fun activities.

See the [follow-up](#using-pathfinder-for-wormhole-mapping-in-turnur) section for instructions on accessing our map of Turnur in PathFinder.  

### Turnur Locals

We cooperate on a limited basis with other groups residing in Turnur to make the day-to-day experience a little less slippery. This means the following. 
* Join the in-game channel `Turnur Locals` on your first day in alliance.
* While **in Turnur** avoid aggression against other members of Turnur Locals. This means on wormholes (in or out of Turnur), stargates, stations, etc. The rules of Turnur locals apply to these areas only. Outside of Turnur or a wormhole leading to/from Turnur, anyone from the channel is free to shoot.
* Facwar plexes and IHUB grids are free game.

This arrangement is not without its faults and mistakes happen sometimes. If you have questions or concerns please bring them up to a member of leadership!

## Things you must own

You **must** own at least one of each of the below.

Some might already be on alliance contract in staging; if they are not, see [Jump freight](#jump-freight) for how to get them shipped in.

Each doctrine is updated via SeaT, which has fits for all DPS, Logi, and relevant support and is in parentheses after the doctrine name in the below list.

### Ships you must own
* 10MN Jam Tengu
* 50MN Gank Tengu
* Nightmare
* 10MN Legion
* Tempest Fleet Issue
* Cyclone Fleet Issue
* Barghest
* Jackdaw
* T2 Torp + FVB Bomber (see alliance contracts)

These are the line dps ships for our main doctrines.

Support ships (other than logi) have handouts available, but if you know you fly a role commonly you can purchase your own copies. They are SRP'd at 100%.

You **must** own a dps ship even if you usually fly support.

### Pods you must own
* Mid-grade Nirvana + SM-705 and EM-805 hardwirings (for use in both Nightmare and Barghest).
* Mid-grade Amulet pod (w/ HG-1005). 
* If you can afford a high-grade pod buy one, but be warned there is **no pod SRP**

## Things you should probably own

* Small-gang nano ships
* Sabres/dictors
* Void bombers for alts
* An armor buffer black ops battleship, or a conduitable armor buffer support ship

## Our other doctrines

N/A currently.

## Jump freight
Our corporation `Sock Workers` accepts courier contracts.

Contracts are generally run at least once daily.

The reward rate for these routes are as follows:
* Jita <==> Turnur: 250 ISK/m3 (5 miliion ISK minimum) 100k m3 max per package

7 days expiry, 7 days to complete.

**Zero collateral** is strongly preferred.  Sock Workers operations are 100% insured with the full faith and backing of Deepwater Hooligans.

Collateral, like guacamole, is extra.
🥑 If you feel the need to use collateral, add 2.5% of your collateral to the above rate -- and be prepared to wait longer, as JF pilots may give priority to uncollateralized contracts.

## Using PathFinder for Wormhole Mapping in Turnur

PathFinder provides a map of wormhole systems represented as a graph of vertices and edges. Each vertex represents a wormhole system, and each edge represents the wormhole connection between systems. This allows you to easily visualize the network of wormholes and navigate through them.

For new members, it is important to follow the naming conventions for wormholes as mentioned in the #pings discord channel. This will ensure the wormholes are correctly identified in your alliance bookmark folder.

See [#pings](https://discord.com/channels/758877276472999936/759154715174502460/1065821031945736202) for BIGAB's official naming convention for wormholes. Our wormhole bookmarks folder is available in the MOTD of our Alliance chat channel.

Visit [PathFinder](https://pf.deepwaterhooligans.com/map) to view the wormhole map. Login with your BIGAB scanning character via ESI. Only in-alliance characters are currently allowed to access the map.
