# How to do blops in Eve Online: Deepwater Hooligans Edition!

This is your guide for blopsing with BIGAB in both low and nullsec. 

The guide is meant to acclaimate our newer members on the differences between your normal drive-by drops and the organized lowsec drops we often do.

If you follow this guide, not only will you feed less, but if you do the fancy pink people will be happy to SRP you!

**For the purpose of this guide, "DPS Blops" are Redeemers. "Utility Blops" are Panthers, Sins, and Widows. Neut Deemers are a special case ship.**  

## Doctrine fits
**All doctrine fits are maintained on SeaT.**

**Additionally, doctrine DPS Redeemer and Widow will need the following:**
* DPS Redeemer will require a Gravid-rolled MWD for powergrid requirements.
* Widow will require High-Grade Amulets its plates to be rolled to 6250+ HP, and it is strongly encouraged to fit upgraded EANMs.

**All blops except for the Widow should have at minimum a Mid-Grade Amulet set with supporting hardwirings.**  
**All non-Redeemer blops need to have a conduit module fitted, and the ability to use it.**

Note on niche fits:
* Niche fits are allowed for certain tasks, such as Tach Deemers, Neut Deemers, etc.
* If you have a niche fit, please clear it with a FC before fitting it up and dropping it, so the FCs know what they have.  
* Please kindly do this in advance rather than as the fleet is forming to minimalize the questions in formup.

**Note: If your blops is a chariot and you are not comfortable being in combat with it, do not use it.**    
**FCs rely on knowing what they have available to them, and if you cannot stay on grid then FCs are at a disadvantage. Please only bring what you are willing to fight in.**

Please note, T3Cs are useful for characters that do not have Black Ops Battleship skills, or are uncomfortable with the ISK needed.  
If you need a fit for a character, feel free to ask a FC or check the #Theorycrafting channel for some recommendations.  

**If your alts cannot fly T3Cs, bringing them in cynos should be your go-to. The fleet will always need more cynos, no matter what.**  

## Lowsec Drops
**All Utility Blops should have a Cyno and Conduit fit. Keep Cloak in cargo.**  
**Remove enough fuel from your cargo to add 3 lights of your cyno (this will vary based on skills)**

* Usually supported by at least one active tanked armor FAX. **Please remember this when you are dropping.**
* Done as part of a smaller drop for a quick drive-by, or a larger drop supported by the alliance.
* Drive-by drops are generally fast form and go, with very little time to log in, sort your clone, and get in - so be quick!
* Larger drops usually involve a bit more time, as we are sorting multiple fax and utility alts.

### General rules for Lowsec drops:
* Check you are Amulets, have your cyno, and have fuel before undocking.
* Confirm with the fleet if Conduits are needed, and fit if necessary.
* Undock when FC says so and get on the Conduit bookmark.
* Keep comms clear unless you are a cyno, FAX, and/or filling a utility role.

### Once you are Conduited and on grid:
**Never, EVER push your MJD module without being told to do so. You will be out of range of FAXes and will have a bad time.**
* Tackle as necessary according to FC.
* Follow primaries.
* Broadcast early so FAX can catch you.
* Ensure you are always close to your FC unless told to burn and tackle a target.
* When grid is clear, focus on the calls of your FC to either approach a Conduit or align to a structure/gate.
* Ensure you are flag accept fleet warp.

## Nullsec Drops
* Most often you can fit a cloak instead of your cyno, but keep it in cargo in case it is needed.
* Not usually supported by a FAX, so be mindful of your positioning and be ready to warp if need be.
* Follow above guidelines on priorities while on grid.
* Focus on FC calls on when to undock/decloak/jump, as you will likely be in hostile space.
