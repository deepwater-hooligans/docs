# Welcome to Deepwater Hooligans!

Welcome to the most crunchwrap supreme mid-scale pvp group.

**Please read this entire document.**  We have done our best to keep it short.

## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay on BIGAB comms:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

## Comms Etiquette:

* During fleet operations, our comms channels can quickly become congested due to the size of our fleets.
* Unless explicitly permitted by the fleet organizer, please be considerate of your fellow alliance members and the fleet's command team.
* Ensure that comms remain clear to facilitate the effective relay and discussion of vital information.
* Even during moments that seem quiet, keep in mind that important discussions may be ongoing in the command whisper channel.
* Please note that not adhering to these rules may lead to global muting measures.

Lastly, don't be a jerk. There should not need to be any examples cited for this. If you have to question whether your actions are unbecoming, they probably are. Be nice to your corp mates and alliance members, don't spam egregiously in local, don't leak anything said in any channel in BIGAB discord for any reason. This rule is interpreted by real people, not a machine, so toeing of the line will not be allowed and if you are found to violate this rule excessively, you will be removed.
