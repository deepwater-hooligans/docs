# Welcome to Deepwater Hooligans!

Welcome to the most crunchwrap supreme mid-scale pvp group.

**Please read this entire document.**  We have done our best to keep it short. These principles and guidelines are carefully created and maintained to ensure everyone has a safe and fun environment in which to play the game.

## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay on BIGAB comms:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

## Comms Etiquette:
* **Listening/Paying Attention**: This is the most important principle of being in a Deepwater Hooligans fleet. Everything you need to be successful in a fleet will either be provided verbally by the fleet team or in the MOTD of the fleet. Please avoid clouding up comms by asking questions that have already been answered or can be answered by reading the MOTD of the fleet. If you have to ask, please use text chat unless it is urgent, in which case you can ask on open comms. 
* **Keeping comms clear**: During fleet ops, our comms channels can quickly become congested due to the size of our fleets. Unless explicitly permitted by the fleet organizer, please be considerate of your fellow alliance members and the fleet's command team. Ensure that comms remain clear to facilitate the effective relay and discussion of vital information. Even during moments that seem quiet, keep in mind that important discussions may be ongoing in the command whisper channel. Please note that not adhering to these rules may lead to global muting measures.
* **Trash talk/local spam**: We generally discourage people from engaging in targeted trashtalk in local during engagements. If you are out solo or roaming, nobody will stop you from doing this, but please don't incite or promote trash talk during fleets. This can easily devolve into disrespectful and mean-spirited attacks on others. Additionally, please avoid copypasta or ASCII spam in local. A coordinated "GF" after a fleet engagement is fine (or a coordinated "Rats never win" after fighting Nadrad). 

## Noisy Topics:
There are some topics that have been known to cause polarizing discussions with no application to the game which we try to avoid. Please avoid extended discussion of these topics in the main communication channels. A small amount of these things in other channels is fine, but please move longer discussions regarding these topics to the appropriate channel or DMs. Some of them have specialized channels and some do not, in which case you will just have to find somewhere else to talk about them.
* Sex/NSFW topics (No channel, sorry.)
* Politics (use the politics thread in #英文普遍聊天-general)
* Religion (No channel, sorry, but the politics thread may be appropriate for certain religious topics)


Lastly, don't be a jerk. There should not need to be any examples cited for this. If you have to question whether your actions are unbecoming, they probably are. Be nice to your corp mates and alliance members, don't spam egregiously in local, don't leak anything said in any channel in BIGAB discord for any reason. This rule is interpreted by real people, not a machine, so toeing of the line will not be allowed and if you are found to violate this rule excessively, you will be removed.
